<h1>Event Formatter</h1>

<h2>Configuring WSO2Event Event Formatter</h2>

<p>This will convert the events which coming from Siddhi in to wso2Events according to the mapping
   configurations.</p>

<p>Hence WSO2Event has three data types (Meta, Correlation and Payload), the CEP back end runtime
   event attributes can be mapped to any one of them by adding the mapping configuration under their
   type names.</p>

<h3>Configuring through the Management Console UI</h3>

<p>1. Log in to the CEP management console and select the <strong>Main</strong> menu in the left
   hand side of the screen. Then select the <strong>Add</strong> menu item under <strong>Event
                                                                                         Formatter</strong>
   menu.</p>

<p>2. The <strong>Create a New Event Formatter</strong> window opens, using which you can configure
   new event formatters. Enter the following details in the form to create a wso2Event mapping based
   event formatter as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p><br/><img src="../images/wso2EventFormatter.png" alt="Create Event Formatter"/></p>

<p>Here, there are several properties that need to be filled when creating a event formatter. User
   interface is divided in to 3 main components (From, Mapping and To) except the event formatter
   name to give more understanding to the user.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Event Formatter Name - Property that used to uniquely identify a event formatter
        configuration.
    </li>
    <li>Event Stream - Can select a event stream (Stream name with version) where you going to
        listen for events, It is numbered as "1".
    </li>
    <li>Stream Attributes - Based on the event stream selected, It shows what are the attributes
        available at that stream. (It is only for reference when creating output mapping)
    </li>
    <li>Output Event Adaptor Name - Event adaptor which you going to use to publish the events from
        CEP. (Output Event Adaptors which are created are listed here). It is numbered as "2". Based
        on the Event Adaptor that selected sections "3", "4" and "5" will change accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>Output Mapping Type - This property can be change based on the event adaptor selected. Some
        event adaptors can support for multiple types of mappings. User can select the required
        mapping type from the list. Is is numbered as "3".
    </li>
    <li>Stream Definition - Since, you have selected WSO2Event type event adaptor "wso2EventSender";
        you need a stream to send events from CEP.
    </li>
    <li>Stream Version - Version of the event stream.</li>
</ul>
<h5>WSO2Event Mapping</h5>

<p>WSO2Event contains three types of data properties. They are Meta Data, Correlation Data and
   Payload Data. Each data property needs to have</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name - The attribute name to which the event data will be mapped when creating the output
        WSO2Event
    </li>
    <li>Value Of - The attribute/property name from which the data element to be mapped</li>
    <li>Type - Type of the element that is being mapped. This can be either of java.lang.String,
        java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long, or java.lang.Double.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>3. After adding details click the <strong>Add Event Formatter</strong> button. The <strong>Available
                                                                                                Event
                                                                                                Formatter</strong>
     page will open. To view event formatter configurations, click on the event formatter name. To
     delete event formatter, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.

</p>

<p>By Clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button of the relevant event formatter, you will able to
   edit the event formatter configuration and redeploy it. When you click the Edit button, it will
   redirect to a xml based editor window which allow you to edit the event formatter configuration
   from UI without opening the configuration file in the file system.</p>

<h3>Configuring through a xml File</h3>

<p>You can specify a event formatter configuration through in a xml file and deploy it in the
   deployment directory in the server. Event Formatter deployment directory is available at &lt;CARBON_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/eventformatters
   . This is an hot deployment directory, then it is easy to deploy and undeploy an event formatter
   configuration.</p>

<p>1. Create a xml file and enter the following WSO2Event mapping event formatter configurations
   inside the above mentioned hot deployment directory. Event formatter implementation needs to be
   start with "eventformatter" root element.</p>
<pre>&lt;eventFormatter name="StatisticsFormatter" xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventformatter"&gt;
        &lt;from streamName="statisticsStream" version="1.0.0"/&gt;
        &lt;mapping type="wso2event"&gt;
            &lt;metaData&gt;
                &lt;property&gt;
                    &lt;from name="ipAddress"/&gt;
                    &lt;to name="ipAdd" type="string"/&gt;
                &lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/metaData&gt;
            &lt;payloadData&gt;
                &lt;property&gt;
                    &lt;from name="user"/&gt;
                    &lt;to name="username" type="string"/&gt;
                &lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/payloadData&gt;
        &lt;/mapping&gt;
        &lt;to eventAdaptorName="wso2EventSender" eventAdaptorType="wso2event"&gt;
            &lt;property name="stream"&gt;statisticsOutStream&lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;property name="version"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/property&gt;
            &lt;/to>
    &lt;/eventFormatter></pre>

   documentation <a

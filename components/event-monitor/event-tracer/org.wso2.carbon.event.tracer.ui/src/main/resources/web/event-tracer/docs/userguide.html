<h2>Configuring Event Tracer</h2>

<p>CEP Event Tracer is an important tool to monitor events. This tool provides huge functionality to trace the event in each and every component. Event tracer will help to check the event when travels along the components. But user needs to enable the tracing in each configuration manually because by default tracing is disabled.ï¿½</p>
<h4>Enabling/Disabling Event Tracer for a Input Event Adaptor Configuration</h4>

<p>As shown above, you can simply enable or disable event tracing for Input Event Adaptor configuration. You can follow the sample approach for <strong>Output Event Adaptor, Event Builder, Event Processor and Event Formatter</strong> as well, But consider any change in tracing status will lead to redeployment of necessary configuration.</p>

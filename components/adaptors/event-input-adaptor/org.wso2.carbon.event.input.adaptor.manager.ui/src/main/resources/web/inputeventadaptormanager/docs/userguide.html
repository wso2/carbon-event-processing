<h1>Input Event Adaptors</h1>

<h2>Configuring WSO2Event Input Event Adaptor</h2>

<p>WSO2Event event adaptor handles WSO2 Common Events. It receives events over Thrift using TCP,
   SSL, HTTP, HTTPS and also JSON events via HTTP and HTTPS. By default, the CEP comes with an
   WSO2Event event adaptor, which is used to receive fired events</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: You can use the WSO2Event event adaptor that comes with the CEP only to
                         receive incoming events. But, CEP can send output events to any (including
                         external) WSO2Event event adaptors.</p>

<p>By default, Input WSO2Event event adaptor starts with CEP, and its default ports are as
   follows:</p>

<p>tcp port : 7611<br/>
   ssl port : 7711<br/>
   http port : 9763 <br/>
   https port : 9443</p>

<p>The steps below explain how to configure using the management console or using an XML file as
   explained in step 5.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to the CEP management console, select<strong>Input Event Adaptors</strong> menu and
        then click <strong>Add Input Event Adaptor</strong>.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Enter details in the form that appears and click<strong> Add Event Adaptor</strong> button
        at the end of the form. For example,<br/>
        <img src="../images/create-event-adaptor.png" alt="Create Event Adaptor"/>
        <br/>Following values are used in the configuration above:<br/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Event Adaptor Name : inputWSO2EventTransportAdaptor</li>
            <li>Event Adaptor Type : wso2event</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>After a adapter is successfully added, you can change its configuration and redeploy it. To
        do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link associated with it. You can also click the
        other links associated with it to delete it or enable statistics and tracing.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>An XML basedï¿½editor opens allowing you to edit the event adaptor configuration from UI
        itself, without having to edit the file in the file system. <span
                style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Do your modifications and click <strong>Update</strong>.</span>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Alternatively, you can specify an event adaptor configuration using an XML file and save it
        in <code>
            &lt;PRODUCT_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/inputeventadaptors</code>
        directory, which is the Input event adaptor deployment directory. Since hot deployment is
        enabled, you can simply add/remove files to deploy/undeploy from the server.<br/>
        <br/>Create the XML file with the following WSO2Event event adaptor configurations.
        Input event adaptor implementation must start with <code>&lt;inputEventAdaptor&gt;</code>
        root element.

    <pre>&lt;inputEventAdaptor name="localEventReceiver" type="wso2event"
                            xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventadaptormanager"&gt;&lt;/inputEventAdaptor&gt;</pre>

    </li>
    <br/>
</ol>
<h3>Configuring stream definition stores for the adaptor</h3>

<p>Stream definition stores are used to store the stream definitions of the incoming event streams.
   WSO2Event event adaptor supports three types of stream definition stores as follows:</p> <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Registry-based stream definition store</li>
    <li>Cassandra-based stream definition store</li>
    <li>In-memory stream definition store</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, CEP uses the registry-based stream definition store. To change the default stream
   definition store, add the appropriate stream definition store implementation class to <code>&lt;PRODUCT_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/data-bridge/data-bridge-config.xml</code>
   file as follows:</p><br/>
<pre>&lt;dataBridgeConfiguration xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/databridge"&gt;
    <!--<StreamDefinitionStore>org.wso2.carbon.databridge.streamdefn.registry.datastore.RegistryStreamDefinitionStore</StreamDefinitionStore>-->
    &lt;StreamDefinitionStore&gt;
        org.wso2.carbon.databridge.streamdefn.cassandra.datastore.CassandraStreamDefinitionStore
    &lt;/StreamDefinitionStore&gt;
    <!--<StreamDefinitionStore>org.wso2.carbon.databridge.core.definitionstore.InMemoryStreamDefinitionStore</StreamDefinitionStore>-->
    ...
&lt;/dataBridgeConfiguration&gt;  </pre>

<p>
    <strong>Info: </strong>: In registry-based stream definition store, the stream
                           definitions are stored in
    <code>/_system/governance/StreamDefinitions</code>.
                           In Cassandra-based stream definition store, the stream definitions
                           are stored in <code>META_KS</code> key space.</p>

<p>For more details on configuring different types of event adaptors, Please refer the official
   documentation <a href="http://docs.wso2.org/display/CEP300/Input+Event+Adaptors">Here.</a></p>

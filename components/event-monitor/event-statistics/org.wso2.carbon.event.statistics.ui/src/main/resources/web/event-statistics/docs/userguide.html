<h1>CEP Event Statistics</h1>

<h2>Configuring CEP Event Statistics</h2>

<p>CEP Event statistics is an important feature that helps for monitoring purposes of events. This
   gives real time request and responses vs time for all the Topics incoming and outgoing CEP. You
   can use this visualization to get an idea about system throughput, input frequency and check
   whether the inputs are received or outputs are published. By default event statistics id disabled
   in CEP to avoid over-head of unnecessary processing of events.</p>
<h4>Enabling/Disabling Event Statistics in CEP</h4>

<p>To enable the event statistics in CEP, user needs to enable the tracing in carbon.xml of the CEP
   server. (&lt;CARBON_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/carbon.xml).</p>

<p>Change the property &lt;StatisticsReporterDisabled&gt;true&lt;/StatisticsReporterDisabled&gt; to
   false to enable event statistics. Event though event statistics is enabled in CEP, It is not
   activated by itself. User needs to activate event statistics for each and every configuration
   that they want since monitoring event statistics takes considerable amount of processing
   overhead.</p>

<p>As shown above, you can simply enable or disable event statistics for event formatter
   configuration. You can follow the sample approach for <strong>Output Event Adaptor, Event
                                                                 Builder, Event Processor and Input
                                                                 Event Adaptor</strong> as well, But
   consider any change in event statistics status (enable or disable) will lead to redeployment of
   necessary configuration.</p>
<h4>Monitoring CEP Event Statistics</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions below to access the Event Tracer.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on "Monitor" on the left side to access the "Monitor" menu.</li>
    <li>In the "Monitor" menu, click on "Event Statistics."<br/>
        <img src="../images/eventStatisticsPath.png" alt="Event statistics path"/><br/></li>
    <li>If you enabled event statistics for all the configurations (from input event adaptor to
        event formatter), then you can see a window like below.
        <br/> <img src="../images/eventstatisticsDefault.png" alt="Event statistics default"/><br/>
    </li><br/>
    <li>If you send events to the CEP, then you can get the actual statistics details as shown below
        (I have used the sample- 0101 for this purpose). If you run the sample, it will send 100
        events by default. Then you can see similar window as shown below.
        <br/><img src="../images/statisticsWindow.png" alt="Event statistics window"/><br/></li><br/>
    <li>As shown above, user can further analyse regarding the requests and responses in each
        configuration in real time...
    </li>
</ol>

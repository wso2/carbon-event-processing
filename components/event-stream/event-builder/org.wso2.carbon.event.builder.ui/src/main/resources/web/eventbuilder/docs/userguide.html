<h1>Event Builder</h1>

<h2>Configuring WSO2Event Event Builder </h2>

<p>WSO2Event Event Builder converts events/streams from an input adaptor that supports WSO2-Events
   into an event stream that is compatible with the event processor. WSO2-Event has three data types
   (meta, correlation and payload), which can be mapped to the CEP backend runtime event attributes
   by specifying the mapping in the event builder.</p>

<p>You can configure through the management console as explained below or by manually adding an XML
   file as explained in step 5. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Start the CEP, log in to its management console, select <strong>Event Builders</strong> and
        click<strong> Add Event Builder</strong>.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Enter details in the form that appears and click the<strong> Add Event Builder</strong>
        button at the end of the form. For example,<br/>
        <br/><img src="../images/wso2-builder.png" alt="Create Event Builder"/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Event Builder Name : Property to uniquely identify an event formatter
                configuration
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Input Event Adaptor (marked as <strong>1</strong> in the screenshot) : The input
                event adaptor used to publish events to the CEP. This drop-down list only displays
                the adaptors that are already created. In this example, we select an Input WSO2Event
                Event Adaptor already created.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Input Event Adaptor properties (marked as <strong>2</strong> in the screenshot) :
                Properties required by the input event adaptor depending on the input event adaptor
                type selected before. For example, if you select WSO2Event, then the required
                properties are: <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stream Definition - Stream name of the incoming WSO2Event stream
                    </li>
                    <li>Stream Version - Version of the incoming stream
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Input Mapping Type (marked as <strong>3</strong> in the screenshot): Select <code>WSO2Event</code>
                mapping type. This property changes based on the event adaptor selected. It lists
                only the mapping types supported by a particular event adaptor.
                <br/>
            </li>
            <li>Mapping properties (marked as <strong>4</strong> in the screenshot) : Map the
                incoming stream to the outgoing stream received by the event processor. In this
                case, mappings are further divided as meta data, correlation data and payload data.
                Provide the necessary details in the input fields:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter the attribute name of the incoming stream in <strong>Input Attribute
                                                                                   Name</strong>
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Enter the attribute name for the outgoing stream in <strong>Mapped
                                                                                    To</strong>
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Select the data type of the attribute from the <strong>To Stream Data
                                                                               Type</strong>
                        drop-down
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the individual attribute mapping to the
                           event builder</p>

                        <p>For the correct properties to show, you must selected a input event
                           adaptor that supports WSO2Event mapping type.</p>

                    </li>
                    <br/>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To Stream Name/Version : Stream name/version of the outgoing stream</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>After a builder is successfully created, you can change its configuration and redeploy it.
        To do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link associated with it. You can also click the
        other links associated with it to delete or enable statistics and tracing.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>An XML basedï¿½editor opens allowing you to edit the event builder configuration from the UI
        itself, without having to edit the file in the file system. Do your modifications and click
        <strong>Update</strong>.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
        <p>Alternatively, you can specify an event builder configuration using an XML file and save
           it in <code>&lt;PRODUCT_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/eventbuilders</code>
           directory, which is the event builder deployment directory. Since hot deployment is
           enabled, you can simply add/remove files to deploy/undeploy from the server.<br/> <br/>Create
           the XML file with the following WSO2Event based event builder configurations. Event
           builder implementation must start with <code>&lt;eventbuilder&gt;</code> root element and
           the namespace set to <code> <a href="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventbuilder">http://wso2.org/carbon/eventbuilder</a>
            </code>as in the example below.</p>
        <br/>
        <pre>&lt;eventBuilder name="SearchStatBuilder" xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventbuilder"&gt;
                &lt;from eventAdaptorName="localEventReceiver" eventAdaptorType="wso2event"&gt;
                    &lt;property name="stream"&gt;access_Analytics&lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property name="version"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;/from&gt;
                &lt;mapping type="wso2event"&gt;
                    &lt;property&gt;
                        &lt;from dataType="meta" name="ipAdd"/&gt;
                        &lt;to name="ipAddress" type="string"/&gt;
                    &lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property&gt;
                        &lt;from dataType="payload" name="username"/&gt;
                        &lt;to name="username" type="string"/&gt;
                    &lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property&gt;
                        &lt;from dataType="payload" name="keywords"/&gt;
                        &lt;to name="searchTerms" type="string"/&gt;
                    &lt;/property&gt;
                &lt;/mapping&gt;
                &lt;to streamName="searchStatistics" version="1.0.0"&gt;
            &lt;/eventBuilder&gt;</pre>

        <p>Here if custom mapping disabled, then it is considered as a pass-through event builder
           which allows to send all the events without pre-configured mapping. But this feature is
           only implemented for wso2Event builder. (you cannot configure execution plan for
           pass-through event builder in UI level, you have to create it in the back-end, because
           CEP don't about the stream definition until first event comes to CEP. Then you can
           configure the execution plan and event formatter in back-end and deploy it.
        </p>
